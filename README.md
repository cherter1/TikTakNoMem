### Repurposing old learning project for Fun Challenge
- This was like the first thing I ever made in C# before I even knew how to program
- Decided it would be a fun challenge to make this with a perfect AI using minimax alg
- Decided it would be also fun to do it with Zero allocations
- May in the Future add a Token limit to really minify it for a challenge.


## BASELINE - Legacy State
- gonna add some stuff in here about how trash it is and some metrics for allocations and GCs if any
